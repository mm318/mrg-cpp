# McIntyre, Richardson, and Grill Axon Model

Reimplementation of the axon model from McIntyre, Richardson, and Grill (2002) in C++.

Visualization (implemented using openFrameworks) is also addded.


## Build

- Obtain the source:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/mm318/mrg-cpp.git -b new_libs
    $ cd mrg-cpp
    ```

- Setup openFrameworks 0.10.1 and its CMake build:

    ```bash
    $ wget https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/archive/0.10.1.tar.gz && tar xvzf 0.10.1.tar.gz && rm 0.10.1.tar.gz
    $ sudo openFrameworks-0.10.1/scripts/linux/ubuntu/install_dependencies.sh   # maybe optional
    $ openFrameworks-0.10.1/scripts/linux/download_libs.sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/mm318/ofxCMake.git openFrameworks-0.10.1/addons/ofxCMake
    ```

- Build like an usual CMake project, for example:
    
    ```bash
    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make -j4
    ```


## Usage

mrg_axon_model <axon file> <V_fe (mV)> <V_applied (mV)> <duration (ms)> <stim start (ms)> <stim end (ms)>

The axon file is in the format (tab separated): <x (m)> <y (m)> <z (m)> <Ve_pulse (V)>


## History

The original implementation was in NEURON, published in:

McIntyre, C., Richardson, A. & Grill, W. (2002). Modeling the excitability of mammalian nerve ﬁbers: Inﬂuence of after potentials on the recovery cycle. J. Neurophysiol., 87, 995–1006.

It was then reimplemented in MATLAB, published at:

https://code.google.com/p/mrg-matlab/

This is a reimplementation of the MATLAB code (also found in ./reference/) in C++.
